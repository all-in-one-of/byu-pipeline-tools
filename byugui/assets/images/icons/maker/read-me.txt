For your convience I have made a byu-tools-icons-maker.xcf GIMP file to make any future icons with. I got it to a pretty good size I feel so all you have to do is find an icon that you want, resize it to fit the gimp file and then export a version with each program icon (ie Maya, Houdini, etc). If you need to add a new program to the pipline you can just make the new icon 440x440px and put in the bottom corner and that seems to work pretty well.
